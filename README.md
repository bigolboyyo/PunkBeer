# Beer Recipe App

This is a simple beer recipe app I created to practice my vanilla JavaScript skills. The app fetches data from the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) and displays information about various beers. Users can click on a beer label to see more details about the beer, such as its ingredients, brewing process, and food pairings.

## Features
